# Hotel Miranda Dashboard

Dashboard for Hotel Miranda. Made with React, React Routing, Redux Toolkit and Styled-Components. Desktop SPA made with React and Redux Toolkit that simulates the dashboard for a hotel where you can add, delete, and see the available bookings, rooms, users...

I used jest to make some test for the Styled Components and Cypress for E2E login test. In the typescript branch you`ll find the project refactor to typescript.
